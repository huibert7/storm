# Project Storm
A custom tag library to easily and quickly build web apps with minimum programming experience.
Also a simple solution to migrate Informix Web Datablade applications to J2EE.

Project Storm is an opinionated framework that clearly defines how reusable components should be developed, used and documented, which simplifies adoption and increases productivity.

Take a look at the documentation on the project's [wiki](https://github.com/huibert7/storm/wiki)
